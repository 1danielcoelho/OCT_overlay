In order to be able to compile this at the laser PC in LUH, two changes have to
be made:

On the file CMakeLists.txt, comment line 43. That is, change 
    set(VTK_DIR "/usr/local/lib/vtk-5.8" CACHE PATH directory FORCE)
to
    #set(VTK_DIR "/usr/local/lib/vtk-5.8" CACHE PATH directory FORCE)

On the file defines.h, make sure line 12 is commented, like so:
    #define AT_HOME     

After this, while in the folder where this file is located, just run
    rosmake --pre-clean
to compile
