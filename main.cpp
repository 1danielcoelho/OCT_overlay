/*  TODO LIST:
 *
 *  -Implement the silhouette visualization from the stereocamera POV
 *    -Got the artifact lines with vtkPolyDataToImageStencil. Apparently the guy
 *     fixed this problem in a newer version, so I need to jack his file and add
 *     to my own program, since I wouldn't recompile VTK at this point even if
 *     I were paid
 *
 *  -Implement the silhouette visualization from the OCT POV
 *    -Apply the inverse OCT->stereo transform; Discard Z coordinate; Find all
 *     edges in the mass poly that belong to only one triangle (outer edges);
 *
 *  -Change m_oct_mass_poly_data_stereo3D to something less stupid
 *
 *  -Maybe find a way to implement opacity encoding
 *
 *  -Have P be read from the file as opposed to being hard-coded
 *
 *
 * */

/* NEXT EXPERIMENT:
*
* */

/*  POSSIBLE BUGS / THINGS TO CHECK:
 *
 * -Generated OCT surface does not have a point corresponding to every x,y
 *  coordinate of the volume
 *
 * -Registration transform not written/read from the correct location
 *
 * -Ensure that if depth map uses left image, then guarantee both use same
 *resolution
 *
 *
 *
 * */

/*NOTES:
* -Needed to install libvtk5.8-qt4 for the lib files of the QVTK widget
*
* -Needed to add the correct export tags on OCT_seg and reg's manifest files
*
* -LED light circle to 9 and 12 volts, power supply disconnected
*
* -stereomathing_SOMIKON.launch -> visualizationOn to true, should also publish
*
* -Change brightness/contrast with dynamic reconfigure
*
* -Use Smaract_Jog_Mode/Jog_Mode/Jog_Mode.pro -> run executable -> Connect ->
*  -> Enc. nullen -> 34 mm -> GO !
